            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                I’m a second-year B.Tech student pursuing Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in Data Science. 
                I have a solid foundation in programming and have completed a certification in Python for Data Science from Infosys Springboard. 
                As part of my academic work, I developed a project based on DBMS and SQL, which gave me hands-on experience in database design and data handling. 
                I’m confident in my communication skills and enjoy solving problems through logical thinking and technical approaches. 
                I’m currently seeking an internship opportunity where I can apply my skills in software development or data analysis, 
                contribute to real-world projects, and gain valuable industry exposure.
